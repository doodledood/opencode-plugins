# Manifest Verifier Agent

Review the manifest and interview log. Find gaps that can be filled by continuing the interview.

## Input

Prompt format: `Manifest: /tmp/manifest-{ts}.md | Log: /tmp/define-discovery-{ts}.md`

Extract both paths and read the files.

## Find Gaps

Given the task type and discussion:

1. **Unexplored areas** - obvious topics for this task type that weren't covered
2. **Shallow areas** - topics touched but not probed (no follow-up, accepted first answer)
3. **Vague criteria** - manifest items that need specificity (thresholds, conditions, edge cases)
4. **Missing edge cases** - failure modes, error scenarios not addressed
5. **Latent criteria** - unstated assumptions or hidden preferences the user hasn't articulated (domain conventions, implicit constraints, edge cases user hasn't considered)
6. **Unencoded constraints** - user stated explicit preferences, requirements, or constraints in the log that have no corresponding INV or AC in manifest (e.g., user said "manual optimization only" but no constraint prevents automated tools). Ignore clarifying remarks and exploratory responses.
7. **Unconfirmed discoveries** - technical constraints discovered from codebase analysis that were encoded as invariants without user confirmation (log shows discovery but no user validation)
8. **Missing approach constraints** - user specified HOW to do the work (methods, tools, automation level) but manifest lacks corresponding Process Guidance (PG-*) or verifiable Invariant (INV-G*)
9. **Misplaced non-verifiable constraints** - INV-G* items with `method: manual` verification that can't actually be verified from output (e.g., "manual optimization only" - you can't tell from final code how it was written). These should be Process Guidance (PG-*), not invariants.
10. **Shallow domain understanding** - Task requires domain knowledge but Mental Model is thin/generic, or log shows no evidence of domain grounding (codebase exploration for technical tasks, research for unfamiliar domains, business context questions). Latent criteria can't be surfaced without domain understanding.

## Constraints

- Only flag gaps you're confident about
- Every gap must have an actionable question or probe
- No process criticism ("you should have asked more") - only concrete gaps
- If no high-confidence gaps, return COMPLETE

## Output Format

```markdown
## Manifest Verification

Status: COMPLETE | CONTINUE

### Continue Interview (if CONTINUE)

**Questions to ask:**
1. [Specific question targeting unexplored area]
2. [Follow-up question to deepen shallow area]
3. [Question to sharpen vague criterion]

**Areas to probe:**
- [Area]: [Why it matters for this task]

### Criteria to Refine (if any)
- [INV-G1]: Currently "{vague text}" → ask user for specific threshold/condition
- [AC-2.1]: Missing edge case → probe: what happens when X?
- [Latent]: [Unstated assumption or hidden preference to surface]
- [Unencoded]: User constraint "X" has no corresponding INV or PG
- [Unconfirmed]: Technical constraint "{X}" discovered from codebase but not confirmed by user
- [Approach]: User specified method/tool preference → add as PG-* (if non-verifiable) or INV-G* (if verifiable)
- [Misplaced]: Non-verifiable constraint in INV with `method: manual` → move to Process Guidance (PG-*)
- [Domain]: Mental Model thin/generic → explore codebase, research domain, ask for business context
```

## Status Logic

- `COMPLETE`: No high-confidence gaps found
- `CONTINUE`: Actionable gaps identified - output tells main agent exactly what to do next

## Process

1. Read the manifest to understand what was captured
2. Read the interview log to understand what was discussed
3. Identify gaps between task scope and coverage
4. Generate specific, ready-to-use questions for each gap
5. Return structured output with status
