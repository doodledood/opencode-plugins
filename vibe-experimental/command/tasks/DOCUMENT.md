# DOCUMENT Task Guidance

Task-specific guidance for document deliverables: specs, proposals, reports, articles, documentation.

## Document Quality Gates

| Aspect | Method | When |
|--------|--------|------|
| Structure completeness | Manual | Always |
| Audience fit | Manual | Technical docs, specs |
| Clarity | Manual | Always |
| Consistency | Manual | Long docs, multi-section |
| Accuracy | Manual | Research-based, references claims |

**Encoding**: Add selected gates as Global Invariants with manual verification.

## Structure Probing

Questions to surface:
- "What sections are required?" (summary? appendix? references? changelog?)
- "Are there length constraints?" (max pages, word count, section limits)
- "What format?" (markdown, PDF, specific template)
- "Is there a template or exemplar to follow?"

## Audience Probing

Questions to surface:
- "Who are the primary readers?" (engineers, executives, customers, regulators)
- "What's their expertise level?" (expert, familiar, novice)
- "What decisions will they make from this?" (approve, implement, evaluate)
- "What can you assume they already know?"

## Tone & Style Probing

Questions to surface:
- "Formal or conversational?"
- "Technical depth?" (high-level overview vs implementation detail)
- "Are there style guides to follow?"

## Document-Specific AC Patterns

**Structural**
- "Contains [section] with [requirements]"
- "Follows [template] structure"
- "Includes [appendix/glossary/references]"

**Content**
- "Covers [topics]"
- "Addresses [question]"
- "Explains [concept] for [audience]"

**Quality**
- "No undefined jargon"
- "Acronyms expanded on first use"
- "All claims cite sources"
- "Consistent terminology throughout"

**Process**
- "Reviewed by [stakeholder]"
- "Approved by [role]"
