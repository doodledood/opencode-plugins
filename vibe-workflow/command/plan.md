description: 'Create implementation plans from spec via iterative codebase research and strategic questions. Produces mini-PR plans optimized for iterative development.'
---

**User request**: $ARGUMENTS

Build implementation plan through structured discovery. Takes spec (from `/spec` or inline), iteratively researches codebase + asks high-priority technical questions that shape implementation direction → detailed plan.

**Focus**: HOW not WHAT. Spec=what; plan=architecture, files, functions, chunks, dependencies, tests.

**Loop**: Research → Expand todos → Ask questions → Write findings → Repeat until complete

**Output files**:
- Plan: `/tmp/plan-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-{name-kebab-case}.md`
- Research log: `/tmp/plan-research-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-{name-kebab-case}.md` (external memory)

## Boundaries

- Spec=requirements; this skill=architecture, files, chunks, tests
- Don't modify spec; flag gaps for user
- Surface infeasibility before proceeding
- No implementation until approved

## Phase 1: Initial Setup

### 1.1 Create todos (TodoWrite immediately)

If TodoWrite unavailable: use research log `## Todos` section with markdown checkboxes.

Todos = **areas to research/decide**, not steps. Expand when research reveals: (a) files/modules beyond current todos, (b) 2+ valid patterns with trade-offs, (c) unanalyzed dependencies, (d) questions blocking existing todos.

**Starter seeds**:
```
- [ ] Spec requirements→log; done when all requirements extracted
- [ ] Codebase research→log; done when patterns + integration points found
- [ ] Approach identification→log (if multiple valid); done when trade-offs documented
- [ ] Architecture decisions→log; done when all decisions captured
- [ ] (expand: areas as research reveals)
- [ ] Refresh: read full research log + spec
- [ ] Finalize chunks; done when all chunks have acceptance criteria
- [ ] Verify plan (attempt 1/5); done when PASS or issues fixed
- [ ] (expand: fix issues, re-verify until PASS)
```

**Evolution example** - "Add real-time notifications":
```
- [x] Spec requirements→log; 3 types, mobile+web extracted
- [x] Codebase research→log; found ws.ts, notification-service.ts, polling in legacy/
- [x] Approach selection→log; WebSocket vs polling? User chose WebSocket
- [ ] Architecture decisions→log; done when all decisions captured
- [ ] Offline storage→log; done when storage strategy decided
- [ ] Sync conflict resolution→log; done when conflict handling defined
- [ ] Service worker integration→log; done when sw role clarified
- [ ] Refresh: read full research log + spec
- [ ] Finalize chunks; done when all chunks have acceptance criteria
```

Note: Approach selection shows **user decision**—not auto-decided. Found two valid approaches, presented trade-offs, user chose.

**Key**: Never prune todos prematurely. Circular dependencies → merge into single todo: "Research {A} + {B} (merged: circular)".

**Adapt to scope**: Simple (1-2 files) → omit approach identification if single valid approach. Complex (5+ files) → add domain-specific todos.

### 1.2 Create research log

Path: `/tmp/plan-research-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-{name-kebab-case}.md`

```markdown
# Research Log: {feature}
Started: {timestamp} | Spec: {path or "inline"}

## Codebase Research
## Approach Trade-offs
## Spec Gaps
## Conflicts
## Risks & Mitigations
## Architecture Decisions
## Questions & Answers
## Unresolved Items
```

## Phase 2: Context Gathering

**Prerequisites**: Requires `vibe-workflow:codebase-explorer`. If Task tool fails (timeout >120s, agent not found, incomplete) OR returns <3 files when expecting multi-module changes (spec lists 3+ components OR feature description contains "across/connects/bridges/end-to-end/spans/links/integrates/coordinates/orchestrates"): do supplementary research with Read/Glob/Grep, note `[SUPPLEMENTED RESEARCH: codebase-explorer insufficient - {reason}]`. Don't retry timeouts.

**If all research fails**: Log `[RESEARCH BLOCKED: {reason}]`, ask user via question: (a) proceed with assumptions or (b) pause for manual context.

### 2.1 Read/infer spec

Extract: requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, constraints, out-of-scope.

**No formal spec?** Infer from conversation. If <2 concrete requirements (concrete = verifiable by test/demo/metric), use question:

```
questions: [{
  question: "Requirements are thin (<2 concrete). How should we proceed?",
  header: "Requirements",
  options: [
    { label: "Run /spec first (Recommended)", description: "Launch structured discovery interview to properly define requirements, acceptance criteria, and constraints before planning." },
    { label: "Provide requirements now", description: "You'll provide the missing requirements in your next message." },
    { label: "Proceed with assumptions", description: "Continue planning with inferred requirements. Gaps will be flagged and verified before approval." }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}]
```

**Handle response**:
- **Run /spec**: Use Skill tool: `/spec {original user request}`. After spec completes, resume planning with spec file path.
- **Provide requirements**: Wait for user input, then re-evaluate requirement count.
- **Proceed with assumptions**: Document inferred requirements in research log under `## Inferred Requirements`, continue to 2.2. Plan-verifier will flag gaps before approval.

### 2.2 Launch codebase-explorer

Task tool with `subagent_type: "vibe-workflow:codebase-explorer"`. Launch multiple in parallel for cross-cutting work (spans modules/layers, e.g., frontend+backend or auth+logging).

Explore: existing implementations, files to modify, patterns, integration points, test patterns.

### 2.3 Read ALL recommended files

No skipping. Gives firsthand knowledge of patterns, architecture, integration, tests.

### 2.4 Update research log

After EACH step:
```markdown
### {timestamp} - {what researched}
- Explored: {areas}
- Key findings: {files, patterns, integration points}
- New areas: {list}
- Architectural questions: {list}
```

### 2.5 Approach Identification & Trade-off Analysis

**CRITICAL**: Before implementation details, identify whether multiple valid approaches exist. This is THE question that cuts option space—answering it eliminates entire planning branches.

Valid approach = (1) fulfills all spec requirements, (2) technically feasible, (3) has at least one "When it wins" condition. Don't present invalid approaches.

**When**: After initial research (2.2-2.4), before any implementation details.

**What counts as multiple approaches**: different architectural layers, implementation patterns (eager/lazy, push/pull), integration points (modify existing vs create new), scopes (filter at source vs consumer). Multiple valid locations = multiple approaches; multiple valid patterns = multiple approaches.

**Process**:
1. From research: Where could this live? How implemented? Who consumes what we're modifying?
2. **One valid approach** → document why in log, proceed
3. **Multiple valid** → STOP until user decides

**Trade-off format** (research log `## Approach Trade-offs`):
```markdown
### Approaches: {what deciding}

**Approach A: {name}**
- How: {description}
- Pros: {list}
- Cons: {list}
- When it wins: {conditions}
- Affected consumers: {list}

**Approach B: {name}**
- How: {description}
- Pros: {list}
- Cons: {list}
- When it wins: {conditions}
- Affected consumers: {list}

**Existing codebase pattern**: {how similar solved}
**Recommendation**: {approach} — {why}
**Choose alternative if**: {honest conditions where other approach wins}
```

**question**:
```
questions: [{
  question: "Which approach for {requirement}?",
  header: "Approach",
  options: [
    { label: "{Recommended} (Recommended)", description: "{Why cleanest}. Choose unless {alt wins}." },
    { label: "{Alternative}", description: "{What offers}. Better if {wins}." }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}]
```

**Recommendation = cleanest**: (1) separation of concerns (if unsure: use layer where similar features live), (2) matches codebase patterns, (3) minimizes blast radius, (4) most reversible. Prioritize 1>2>3>4.

**Be honest**: State clearly when alternative wins. User has context you don't (future plans, team preferences, business constraints).

**Skip asking only when**: genuinely ONE valid approach (document why others don't work) OR ALL five measurable skip criteria true:
1. Same files changed by both
2. No consumer behavior change
3. Reversible in <1 chunk (<200 lines)
4. No schema/API/public interface changes
5. No different error/failure modes

If ANY fails → Priority 0, ask user.

**STOP**: Never commit to approach without checking alternatives. Never proceed to P1-5 before approach decided. Never modify data-layer without analyzing consumers.

### 2.6 Write initial draft

**Precondition**: Approach decided (single documented OR user chose/delegated after trade-offs). Don't write until Priority 0 resolved.

First draft with `[TBD]` markers. Same file path for all updates.

## Phase 3: Iterative Discovery Interview

**CRITICAL**: Use question for ALL questions—never plain text. If unavailable: structured markdown with numbered options. For Priority 0 without question: MUST include "Planner decides based on recommendation" option.

**No response handling**: Priority 0 = blocking (after 2 follow-ups: "Planning blocked pending decision. Reply or say 'delegate'."); Priority 1-5 = proceed with recommendation, note `[USER UNRESPONSIVE: proceeding with recommendation]`.

**Example** (1-4 questions per call):
```
questions: [
  {
    question: "Full implementation or minimal stub?",
    header: "Phasing",
    options: [
      { label: "Full implementation (Recommended)", description: "Complete per spec" },
      { label: "Minimal stub", description: "Interface only, defer impl" },
      { label: "Incremental", description: "Core first, enhance later" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }
]
```

### Discovery Loop

1. Mark todo `in_progress`
2. Research (codebase-explorer) OR ask (question)
3. **Write findings immediately** to research log
4. Expand todos for new questions/dependencies
5. Update plan (replace `[TBD]`)
6. Mark todo `completed`
7. Repeat until no pending todos

**STOP**: Never proceed without writing findings. Never keep discoveries as mental notes. Never forget expanding todos.

**Contradictions**: (1) Inform user: "Contradicts earlier X. Proceeding with new answer." (2) Log under `## Conflicts`. (3) Re-evaluate todos. (4) Update plan. Unresolvable → ask priority; still blocked → log under `## Unresolved Items`, proceed with most recent, add risk note.

**Log format**:
```markdown
### {timestamp} - {what}
**Todo**: {which}
**Finding/Answer**: {result}
**Impact**: {revealed/decided}
**New areas**: {list or "none"}
```

Architecture decisions: `- {Area}: {choice} — {rationale}`

### Todo Expansion Triggers

| Research Reveals | Add Todos For |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Multiple valid locations** | **Approach trade-off → user decision (P0)** |
| **Multiple consumers** | **Consumer impact → approach implications** |
| Existing similar code | Integration approach |
| Multiple valid patterns | Pattern selection |
| External dependency | Dependency strategy |
| Complex state | State architecture |
| Cross-cutting concern | Concern isolation |
| Performance-sensitive | Performance strategy |
| Migration needed | Migration path |

### Interview Rules

**Unbounded loop**: Iterate until ALL completion criteria met. User delegates ("just decide", "you pick") → document with `[INFERRED: {choice} - {rationale}]`. **Priority 0 exception**: Delegation requires trade-offs shown first with explicit "Planner decides" option. User cannot delegate P0 without seeing trade-offs.

**User rejects all**: Ask "What constraints make these unsuitable?" Log under `## Conflicts`, research alternatives.

**Spec-first**: Questions here are TECHNICAL only. Spec gaps → flag in `## Spec Gaps`, ask user: pause for update OR proceed with assumption.

1. **Prioritize questions that eliminate others** - If knowing X makes Y irrelevant, ask X first

2. **Interleave discovery and questions**: User answer reveals new area → codebase-explorer; need external context → web-researcher via Task (subagent_type: "vibe-workflow:web-researcher"; if unavailable: ask user "Need context about {topic}. Provide: {specific info}"); update plan after each iteration

3. **Question priority**:

| Priority | Type | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|------|---------|----------|
| **0** | **Approach Selection** | **Which fundamental approach** | **Data vs presentation layer? Filter at source vs consumer?** |
| 1 | Phasing | How much now vs later | Full vs stub? Include migration? |
| 2 | Branching | Open/close paths | Sync vs async? Polling vs push? |
| 3 | Technical Constraints | Non-negotiable limits | Must integrate with X? Performance reqs? |
| 4 | Architectural | Choose patterns | Error strategy? State management? |
| 5 | Detail Refinement | Fine-grained details | Test coverage? Retry policy? |

**Priority 0 MANDATORY**: If multiple valid approaches exist → ask before P1-5. **Exception**: Skip only when ALL five skip criteria true. **Dependency exception**: If P0 depends on P3 constraint, ask constraint first with context, then immediately P0.

4. **Always mark "(Recommended)"** first with reasoning. For P1-5 (NOT P0): if same observable behavior AND easily reversible (<100 lines, <5 importers, no migrations) → decide yourself.

5. **Be thorough via technique**: Cover all applicable priority categories; batch up to 4 related same-priority questions; never batch P0 with P1-5

6. **Non-obvious questions**: Error handling, edge cases, performance, testing approach, rollback/migration, failure modes

7. **Ask vs Decide**:

   **Ask when**: Trade-offs affecting outcomes (adds abstraction, changes pattern, locks 3+ PRs, user-facing change, >20% perf change), no codebase precedent, multiple valid approaches, phasing, breaking changes, resource allocation

   **Decide when**: Existing pattern, industry standard, sensible defaults, easily changed (1-2 files, <100 lines, <5 importers, no migrations), implementation detail, clear best practice

   **Test**: "Would user say 'not what I meant' (ASK) or 'works, similar' (DECIDE)?"

## Phase 4: Finalize & Present

### Completion Criteria

Before finalizing, ALL must be met:
- [ ] Priority 0 resolved (single approach OR user chose/delegated after trade-offs)
- [ ] All todos completed
- [ ] Requirements mapped to chunks
- [ ] Risks captured with mitigations
- [ ] NFRs addressed per chunk (Required/N/A/Addressed)
- [ ] Migrations covered if schema/API touched

If ANY unmet → resolve first.

### 4.1 Final research log update

```markdown
## Planning Complete
Finished: {timestamp} | Entries: {count} | Decisions: {count}
## Summary
{Key decisions}
```

### 4.2 Refresh context

Read full research log to restore findings, decisions, rationale before final plan.

### 4.3 Finalize plan

**STOP**: Never finalize with `[TBD]` markers. Never implement without approval.

Remove `[TBD]`, ensure chunk consistency, verify dependency ordering, add line ranges for files >500 lines.

### 4.4 Verify plan (loop until PASS, max 5 attempts)

**Verification loop**:

```
attempt = 1
while attempt <= 5:
  1. Launch plan-verifier agent
  2. If PASS → exit loop, proceed to 4.5
  3. If ISSUES_FOUND:
     a. Expand todos for each issue
     b. Fix BLOCKING issues (must fix)
     c. Review WARNING issues (fix or document why acceptable)
     d. Update plan file
     e. Write fixes to research log
     f. attempt += 1
  4. If attempt > 5 → present to user with remaining issues noted
```

**Launch verifier**:

```
Task(subagent_type: "vibe-workflow:plan-verifier", prompt: "
Plan file: {plan path}
Spec file: {spec path or 'none'}
Research log: {research log path}
Attempt: {attempt}/5
")
```

**Per-attempt todo expansion** (if ISSUES_FOUND):

```
- [ ] Fix: {BLOCKING issue 1}
- [ ] Fix: {BLOCKING issue 2}
- [ ] Review: {WARNING issue 1} - fix or document
- [ ] Re-run plan-verifier (attempt {N+1}/5)
```

**Issue handling by severity**:

| Severity | Action | Blocks Approval? |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| BLOCKING | Must fix before next attempt | Yes |
| WARNING | Fix if appropriate, or add to `## Accepted Warnings` in research log with rationale | No (if documented) |
| INFO | Note in research log, no action needed | No |

**Common fixes**:
- **Dependency inconsistency**: Update `Depends on:` field to inherit parallel chunk's dependencies
- **Missing acceptance criteria**: Add `Acceptance:` section to chunk
- **Uncovered spec requirement**: Add tasks to existing chunk or create new chunk
- **TBD markers**: Resolve with actual values or ask user if uncertain
- **Circular dependency**: Restructure chunks to break cycle

**After 5 failed attempts**: Present approval summary with remaining issues prominently displayed. User decides whether to approve with known issues or request manual fixes.

### 4.5 Mark all todos complete

### 4.6 Present approval summary

Present a scannable summary that allows approval without reading the full plan. Users may approve based on this summary alone.

```
## Plan Approval Summary: {Feature Name}

**Full plan**: /tmp/plan-{...}.md

### At a Glance
| Aspect | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| Approach | {Chosen approach from P0 decision} |
| Chunks | {count} mini-PRs |
| Parallel | {Which chunks can run in parallel, or "Sequential"} |
| Primary Risk | {Main risk + mitigation} |

|----------|--------|-----------|
| Approach (P0) | {Choice} | {Brief why} |
| {Area} | {Choice} | {Brief why} |

---
Approve to start implementation, or request adjustments.
```

**Execution flow guidelines**:
- Show chunk numbers and brief names
- Use arrows to show dependencies: `│ ▼ ─ >`
- Group parallel chunks side-by-side
- Use box characters: `┌ ┐ └ ┘ │ ─` or simple ASCII: `+---+`, `|`, `--->`
- Label parallel opportunities clearly
- Keep diagram compact but readable
- For simple sequential plans: vertical flow
- For complex plans: show critical path + parallel branches

### 4.7 Wait for approval

Do NOT implement until user explicitly approves. After approval: create todos from chunks, execute.

# Planning Methodology

## 1. Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Safety** | Never skip gates (type checks, tests, lint); each chunk tests+demos independently |
| **Clarity** | Full paths, numbered chunks, rationale for context files, line ranges |
| **Minimalism** | Ship today's requirements; parallelize where possible |
| **Forward focus** | Internal code: no backward compat priority; public API/schema: always require migration |
| **Cognitive load** | Deep modules with simple interfaces > many shallow |
| **Conflicts** | Safety (compiles+formatted) > P1 (correct) > Clarity > Minimalism > Forward focus > P2-P10 |

**Definitions**:
- **Gates**: type checks (0 errors), tests (pass), lint (clean)
- **Mini-PR**: chunk sized for independent PR—complete, mergeable, reviewable
- **Deep modules**: few public methods, rich internal logic

### Code Quality (P1-P10)

User intent takes precedence for P2-P10. P1 and Safety gates are non-negotiable.

| # | Principle | Implication |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| P1 | Correctness | Chunk must demonstrably work |
| P2 | Observability | Plan logging, error visibility |
| P3 | Illegal States Unrepresentable | Types prevent compile-time bugs |
| P4 | Single Responsibility | Each chunk ONE thing |
| P5 | Explicit Over Implicit | Clear APIs, no hidden behaviors |
| P6 | Minimal Surface Area | YAGNI |
| P7 | Tests | Specific cases, not "add tests" |
| P8 | Safe Evolution | Public API/schema → migration |
| P9 | Fault Containment | Failure isolation, retry/fallback |
| P10 | Comments Why | Document why when: domain knowledge, external business rule, intentional deviation |

**Values**: Mini-PR > monolithic; parallel > sequential; function-level > code details; dependency clarity > implicit coupling; ship-ready > half-built

## 2. Mini-PR Chunks

Each chunk must:
1. Ship complete value (demo independently without subsequent chunks: logic via tests, API via curl, UI via isolated render)
2. Pass all gates
3. Be mergeable alone (1-3 functions, <200 lines)
4. Include tests (specific inputs/scenarios)

## 3. Chunk Sizing

| Complexity | Chunks | Guidance |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Simple | 1-2 | 1-3 functions each |
| Medium | 3-5 | <200 lines per chunk |
| Complex | 5-8 | Each verifiable via tests |
| Integration | +1 final | Connect prior work |

**Decision guide**: New schema → types first | 4+ files/6+ functions → split by concern | Complex integration → foundation then integration | <200 lines → single chunk OK

## 4. Dependency Ordering

- **True**: uses types, calls functions, extends
- **False**: same feature, no interaction → parallelize
- Minimize chains: A→B, A→C, then B,C→D (not A→B→C→D)
- Circular → extract shared interfaces into foundation chunk
- Number chunks; mark parallel opportunities

## 5. What Belongs

| Belongs | Does Not |
|---------|----------|
| Numbered chunks, gates, todos | Code snippets |
| File manifests with reasons | Extra features, future-proofing |
| Function names only | Micro-optimizations, assumed knowledge |

## 6. Cognitive Load

- Deep modules first: fewer with simple interfaces
- Minimize indirection: layers only for concrete extension
- Composition root: one wiring point
- Decide late: abstraction only when needed
- Framework at edges: core agnostic, thin adapters
- Reduce choices: one idiomatic approach per concern
- Measure: if understanding requires 4+ files or 6+ calls → simplify

## 7. Common Patterns

| Pattern | Flow |
|---------|------|
| Sequential | Model → Logic → API → Errors |
| Parallel after foundation | Model → CRUD (parallel) → Integration |
| Pipeline | Types → Parse/Transform (parallel) → Format → Errors |
| Authentication | User model → Login → Middleware → Logout |
| Search | Structure → Algorithm → API → Ranking |

## 8. Plan Template

```markdown
# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: [Feature]

Spec: {spec path or "none"}

[1-2 sentences]

Gates: Type checks (0 errors), Tests (pass), Lint (clean)

---

## Approach Decision (Priority 0)
- **Chosen**: {approach}
- **Alternatives**: {list with trade-offs}
- **Rationale**: {why}
- **Revisit if**: {conditions}

---

## Requirement Coverage
- [Requirement] → Chunk N

---

## 1. [Name]

Depends on: - | Parallel: -

[What delivers]

Files to modify:
- path.ts - [changes]

Files to create:
- new.ts - [purpose]

Context:
- ref.ts - [why relevant]

Notes: [Assumptions, risks]

Tasks:
- Implement fn() - [purpose]
- Tests - [cases]
- Run gates

Acceptance:
- Gates pass
- [Specific criterion]

Functions: fn(), helper()
Types: TypeName
```

### Good Example

```markdown
## 2. Add User Validation Service

Depends on: 1 (User types) | Parallel: 3

Implements email/password validation with rate limiting.

Files to modify:
- src/services/user.ts - Add validateUserInput()

Files to create:
- src/services/validation.ts - Validation + rate limiter

Context:
- src/services/auth.ts:45-80 - Existing validation patterns
- src/types/user.ts - User types from chunk 1

Tasks:
- validateEmail() - RFC 5322
- validatePassword() - Min 8, 1 number, 1 special
- rateLimit() - 5 attempts/min/IP
- Tests: valid email, invalid formats, password edges, rate limit
- Run gates

Acceptance:
- Gates pass
- validateEmail() rejects invalid, accepts RFC 5322
- validatePassword() enforces min 8, 1 number, 1 special
- Rate limiter blocks after 5 attempts/min/IP

Functions: validateUserInput(), validateEmail(), rateLimit()
Types: ValidationResult, RateLimitConfig
```

### Bad Example

```markdown
## 2. User Stuff
Add validation for users.
Files: user.ts
Tasks: Add validation, Add tests
```

**Why bad**: No dependencies, vague, missing paths, no context, generic tasks, no functions, no acceptance.

## 9. File Manifest & Context

- Every file to modify/create with changes and purpose
- Full paths; zero assumed knowledge
- Context files: explain WHY; line ranges for >500 lines

## 10. Quality Criteria

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Good | Chunks ship value; ordered dependencies; parallel identified; explicit files; context reasons; tests in todos; gates listed |
| Excellent | + optimal parallelization, line numbers, clear integration, risks, alternatives, reduced cognitive load |

### Quality Checklist

**MUST**: Correctness (boundaries, null/empty, errors), Type safety (prevent invalid states, boundary validation), Tests (critical + error + boundary)

**SHOULD**: Observability (errors with context), Resilience (timeouts, retries, cleanup), Clarity (descriptive names), Modularity (<200 lines, minimal coupling), Evolution (public changes have migration)

### Test Importance

| Score | What | Requirement |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Data mutations, money, auth, state machines | MUST |
| 7-8 | Business logic, API contracts, errors | SHOULD |
| 5-6 | Edge cases, boundaries, integration | GOOD |
| 1-4 | Trivial getters, pass-through | OPTIONAL |

### Error Handling

For external systems/user input: (1) what can fail, (2) how failures surface, (3) recovery strategy. Avoid: empty catch, catch-return-null, silent fallbacks, broad catching.

## 11. Problem Scenarios

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| No requirements | Research → unclear: ask OR stop → non-critical: assume+document |
| Extensive requirements | MUSTs first → research → ask priority trade-offs → defer SHOULD/MAY |
| **Multiple approaches** | **STOP. Trade-offs per 2.5 → ASK (P0) → proceed after decision. Never assume "obvious".** |
| Everything dependent | Types first → question dependencies → find false ones → foundation → parallel → integration |

## Planning Mantras

**Always**:
1. Write findings BEFORE next step
2. Every follow-up discovery → todo
3. Update research log after EACH step

**Primary**: 4. Smallest shippable? 5. Passes gates? 6. Explicitly required? 7. Passes review first time?

**Secondary**: 8. Ship with less? 9. Dependencies order? 10. Research first, ask strategically? 11. Reduces cognitive load? 12. Satisfies P1-P10? 13. Error paths planned?

### Never Do

- Write to project dirs (always `/tmp/`; if denied: ask for alternative)
- Expand scope (spec phase; exception: 2-req minimum or blocking ambiguity)
- Skip todos

## Recognize & Adjust

| Symptom | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Chunk >200 lines | Split by concern |
| No clear value | Merge or refocus |
| Dependencies unclear | Make explicit, number |
| Context missing | Add files + line numbers |
| **Alternative approach after draft** | **STOP. Back to 2.5. Document, ask, may restart** |
| **"Obvious" location without checking consumers** | **STOP. Grep usages. Multiple consumers → P0** |
| **User rejects approach during/after impl** | **Should have been P0. Document lesson, present alternatives** |
