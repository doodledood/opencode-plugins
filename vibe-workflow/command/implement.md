description: 'Executes implementation plans via subagents with automated verification and fix loops. Use after /plan for complex features. Each chunk gets dedicated Implementor + Verifier agents with up to 5 fix attempts.'
---

**User request**: $ARGUMENTS

Autonomously execute plan chunks via Implementor and Verifier subagents. Each chunk is isolated: implemented by one agent, verified by another, with automated fix loops.

**Fully autonomous**: No pauses except these blocking issues: (1) git conflicts with overlapping changes in the same lines, (2) package manager failures (any package install command returning non-zero, e.g., npm/yarn/pnpm, pip/poetry, cargo, go mod), (3) OS permission errors on file read/write. No other issues are blocking.

**Gates**: Automated verification commands (typecheck, lint, test) detected from project config. See "Gate Detection" section for resolution order. If no gates detected, verification passes based on acceptance criteria only.

## Workflow

```
For each chunk:
  1. Spawn Implementor agent → implements chunk
  2. Spawn Verifier agent → checks gates + acceptance criteria
  3. If FAIL → fix loop (max 5 total attempts including initial, escalate on same-error)
  4. If PASS → update progress, next chunk
```

## Phase 1: Parse Plan & Setup

### 1.1 Resolve Input

**Review flag**: Review workflow runs by default after implementation. If arguments contain `--no-review` (case-insensitive), disable it. Remove flag from arguments before processing below.

**Priority order:**
1. **`--progress <path>`** → resume from progress file
2. **File path** (ends in `.md` or starts with `/`) → use plan file
3. **Inline task** (any other text) → create ad-hoc single chunk:
   ```
   ## 1. [First 50 characters of task, truncated at last space before character 50; full text if under 50 chars; at char 50 if no spaces]
   - Depends on: -
   - Tasks: [full user text]
   - Files: (implementor discovers)
   - Acceptance criteria: derived from task text (convert to verifiable statement per 1.2 rules); all detected gates must pass (required regardless of other criteria)
   ```
4. **Empty** → error: "Provide plan path, inline task, or run /plan first"

### 1.2 Parse Chunks

For each `## N. [Name]` header, extract:
- Dependencies (`Depends on:` field, `-` = none)
- Files to modify/create with descriptions
- Context files (paths, optional line ranges)
- Implementation tasks (bullet list)
- Acceptance criteria (if missing: derive from tasks by converting each task to a verifiable statement, e.g., "Add login button" → "Login button exists and is clickable". If task cannot be converted to verifiable statement, use: "Implementation matches task description: [task text]" and rely on gates only. Always include "all gates pass" as baseline)
- Key functions/types (passed to implementor for context; not used for verification)

### 1.3 Build Dependency Graph

Order: No-dependency chunks first (by chunk number: ## 1 before ## 2), then topological order (ties broken by chunk number).

### 1.4 Create Progress File

Path: `/tmp/implement-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-{name-kebab-case}.md`

**Timestamp format**: All timestamps use ISO 8601: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` (e.g., `2026-01-09T14:30:00`).

```markdown
# Implementation Progress: [Plan Name]

Started: [timestamp]
Plan: [path to plan file]
Status: IN_PROGRESS

## Chunks

### Chunk 1: [Name]
Status: PENDING
Attempts: 0
Implementor log: (none)
Verifier log: (none)
Files created: []
Files modified: []
Out-of-scope fixes: []
Notes:

### Chunk 2: [Name]
Status: PENDING
...

## Summary
Completed: 0/N chunks
Last updated: [timestamp]
```

### 1.5 Create Todo List

Build todos with 4 items per chunk, plus finalization:
```
[ ] Implement chunk 1: [Name]; done when implementor returns success
[ ] Verify chunk 1: [Name]; done when verifier returns PASS
[ ] (Expand: fix loop for chunk 1 if needed)
[ ] Commit chunk 1: [Name]; done when commit SHA captured
[ ] Implement chunk 2: [Name]; done when implementor returns success
[ ] Verify chunk 2: [Name]; done when verifier returns PASS
[ ] (Expand: fix loop for chunk 2 if needed)
[ ] Commit chunk 2: [Name]; done when commit SHA captured
...
[ ] Read progress file for summary
# Unless --no-review, append:
[ ] Run review on implemented changes; done when review complete
[ ] (Expand: fix review issues as findings emerge)
```

All todos created at once via todo, status `pending`. Fix loop placeholder is marked completed and replaced with implement/verify pairs during Phase 3 (see 3.1).

### 1.6 Handle Resume

If `--progress` argument provided:
1. Read progress file
2. Skip chunks with status `COMPLETE`
3. Resume from first `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS` chunk
4. For `IN_PROGRESS` chunks: if `Implementor log` exists, spawn verifier to check current state; if PASS, continue; if FAIL, enter fix loop from current attempt count. If no `Implementor log`, restart chunk from implementation step.

## Phase 2: Execute Chunks (Subagent Orchestration)

**Prerequisites**: todo tool, Task tool with subagent_type support, installed agents: `vibe-workflow:chunk-implementor`, `vibe-workflow:chunk-verifier`.

**CRITICAL**: Execute continuously without pauses.

For each chunk in dependency order:

### 2.1 Spawn Implementor Agent

1. Mark implement todo `in_progress`
2. **Update progress file**: chunk status → `IN_PROGRESS`, `Last updated` timestamp
3. Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "vibe-workflow:chunk-implementor"`:

```
Implement chunk N: [Name]

## Full Chunk Definition
[Copy the ENTIRE chunk verbatim from the plan, including:
- Depends on / Parallel
- Description
- Files to modify (with descriptions)
- Files to create (with purposes)
- Context files (with line ranges)
- Tasks
- Acceptance criteria
- Key functions / Types]

[If retry: ## Fix Context
Attempt: N/5
Verifier log: [path for detailed gate output]

### Direct Issues (in chunk's files)
[errors in files this chunk created/modified]

### Indirect Issues (in other files)
[errors in files NOT touched by chunk - your changes broke these]
Files: [list of affected files from Indirect issues]

Fix Direct first. For Indirect: fix in your files if possible, else edit listed files. See verifier log for full gate output.]
```

4. Wait for completion, parse output:
   - Check for `## Chunk Implementation Blocked` → if BLOCKED, skip remaining steps and escalate (Phase 4)
   - Extract `Log file:` path
   - Extract `Files created:` and `Files modified:` lists
   - Extract `Out-of-scope fixes:` if present (Indirect issue fixes)
   - Extract `Confidence:` (HIGH = all tasks completed exactly as specified with no interpretation needed; MEDIUM = all tasks completed but required interpreting ambiguous requirements or choosing between valid approaches; LOW = tasks completed but required deviation that changes approach/architecture, e.g., different libraries, changed API signatures. If tasks are partially completed or blocked, implementor returns BLOCKED status instead). All confidence levels proceed to verification; LOW confidence triggers note in final summary. Extract `Uncertainty:` reason if present
5. **Update progress file**: `Implementor log`, `Files created`, `Files modified`, `Out-of-scope fixes`, `Confidence`, `Uncertainty`, `Last updated`
6. Mark implement todo `completed`

### 2.2 Spawn Verifier Agent

1. Mark verify todo `in_progress`
2. Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "vibe-workflow:chunk-verifier"`:

```
Verify chunk N: [Name]

## Full Chunk Definition
[Copy the ENTIRE chunk verbatim - same as implementor received]

## Implementor Log File
[Path from implementor's output, e.g., /tmp/implement-chunk-1-20260107-120000.md]

[If retry: ## Previous Errors
[Errors from last verification for same-error detection]]
```

3. Wait for result, parse output:
   - Extract `Status:` (PASS/FAIL)
   - Extract `Log file:` path
   - Extract issues: `Direct` (chunk's files) and `Indirect` (other files)
   - Check `Same as previous:` if retry (same-error = same file path AND (same error code if present, e.g., TS2322/E501, OR same error message first line if no code); test failures: same test name counts as same error regardless of assertion message; different line numbers still count as same error; new error types or new files = different errors. Comparison is against immediately previous attempt only.)
4. **Update progress file**: `Verifier log`, `Last updated`

### 2.3 Process Verification Result

**If Status: PASS**
1. Mark verify todo `completed`
2. Mark fix loop placeholder `completed` (not needed)
3. **Update progress file**: chunk status → `COMPLETE`, `Completed: N/M`, `Last updated`
4. Commit chunk (see 2.4)
5. Continue to next chunk

**If Status: FAIL**
1. **Update progress file**: increment `Attempts`, add issues to `Notes`, `Last updated`
2. Check for git issues (`Git issue:` in output) → if found, main agent attempts resolution per section 2.4 rules. If resolvable, re-verify (don't count as attempt). If unresolvable, escalate to user (Phase 4).
3. Check attempt count (max 5 total including initial)
4. Check for same-error condition
5. If same-error detected at any attempt → escalate immediately (Phase 4)
6. If can retry (attempts < 5 AND no same-error) → enter fix loop (Phase 3)
7. If max attempts (5) reached → escalate (Phase 4)

### 2.4 Commit Chunk (Main Agent Only)

**CRITICAL**: Main agent handles all git operations directly. Subagents NEVER perform git actions.

1. Mark commit todo `in_progress`
2. Stage files from chunk: `git add [files created/modified]`
3. Commit with message: `feat(plan): implement chunk N - [Name]`
4. **Do NOT push** - push happens at end or on user request
5. **Update progress file**: add commit SHA to chunk notes
6. Mark commit todo `completed`

**If git operation fails** (conflicts, dirty state, etc.):
1. Log issue in progress file
2. Attempt automated resolution only for: dirty working directory (`git stash`), unstaged changes (`git stash`). If stash succeeds, pop after git operation completes (`git stash pop`); if pop conflicts, leave stash intact and log in Notes. If stash operation fails, treat as unresolvable. Never attempt conflict resolution, branch switching, or rebase operations.
3. If unresolvable, report to user with specific error
4. Stop execution - user must resolve before resuming

## Phase 3: Fix Loop

When verification fails and retry is possible:

### 3.1 Expand Fix Loop Placeholder

Replace fix loop placeholder todo with specific items:
```
[x] (Expand: fix loop for chunk N if needed) → completed
[ ] Fix attempt 1: implement chunk N
[ ] Fix attempt 1: verify chunk N
[ ] (Expand: additional fix attempts if needed)
```

### 3.2 Analyze Failure

From verifier output, identify:
- Gate failures (specific errors)
- Acceptance criteria failures
- File:line locations

### 3.3 Respawn Implementor with Fix Context

1. Mark fix implement todo `in_progress`
2. Spawn implementor via Task tool (as in 2.1), including the full chunk definition AND the `## Fix Context` section with attempt number, verifier log path, and categorized issues
3. **Update progress file**: new `Implementor log`, updated files, `Last updated`
4. Mark fix implement todo `completed`

### 3.4 Re-verify

1. Mark fix verify todo `in_progress`
2. Respawn verifier with `previous_errors` for same-error detection
3. **Update progress file**: new `Verifier log`, `Last updated`

### 3.5 Process Result

**If PASS**:
1. Mark fix verify todo `completed`
2. Mark additional attempts placeholder `completed`
3. **Update progress file**: status → `COMPLETE`, `Completed: N/M`, `Last updated`
4. Commit chunk (2.4)
5. Continue to next chunk

**If FAIL with different errors** (at least one previous error resolved OR new error type appeared; if all previous errors persist plus new ones, treat as same-error):
1. **Update progress file**: increment `Attempts`, update `Notes`, `Last updated`
2. If attempts < 5 → expand placeholder, repeat fix loop (3.2)

**If FAIL with same errors OR attempts >= 5**:
1. **Update progress file**: status → `FAILED`, `Notes` with reason, `Last updated`
2. Escalate (Phase 4)

## Phase 4: Escalation & Completion

### 4.1 Escalation

When chunk cannot be completed:

1. **Update progress file**: overall status → `FAILED`, chunk status → `FAILED`, `Last updated`
2. Report to user:

```
## Implementation Blocked

Chunk [N]: [Name] failed after [X] attempts.

### Last Verification Result
[Verifier's output]

### Attempts History
1. [Issues from attempt 1]
2. [Issues from attempt 2]
...

### Recommendation
[Actionable next step: (1) specific code fix if error is clear, (2) "Review [file:line] - error suggests [interpretation]" if ambiguous, or (3) "Re-plan chunk - scope may be incorrect" if repeated failures on different errors]

Progress saved to: [progress file path]
Resume with: /implement --progress [path]
```

Stop implementation. User must intervene.

### 4.2 Successful Completion

When all chunks complete:

1. **Update progress file**: overall status → `COMPLETE`, `Completed: N/N`, `Last updated`
2. Mark "Read progress file for summary" todo `in_progress`
3. **Read full progress file** to restore all chunk details (files created/modified, confidence levels, uncertainty notes) into recent context
4. Mark "Read progress file for summary" todo `completed`
5. Report to user:

```
## Implementation Complete

Chunks: N | Files created: [list] | Files modified: [list]

### Chunk Summary
1. [Name] - [files touched]
2. [Name] - [files touched] - ⚠️ [uncertainty reason]

### Notes
[Any warnings, assumptions, or follow-ups]

Progress file: [path]
Run `/review` for quality verification.
```

6. Unless `--no-review` → proceed to Phase 5

## Phase 5: Review Workflow (default, skip with --no-review)

Skip if `--no-review` was set.

### 5.1 Run Review

1. Mark "Run review" todo `in_progress`
2. Invoke: `/review --autonomous`
3. Mark "Run review" todo `completed`
4. If no issues → mark fix placeholder `completed`, done; else → 5.2

### 5.2 Fix Review Issues

1. Expand fix placeholder:
   ```
   [x] (Expand: fix review issues as findings emerge)
   [ ] Fix critical/high severity issues
   [ ] Re-run review to verify fixes
   [ ] (Expand: additional fix iterations if needed)
   ```
2. Mark "Fix critical/high" `in_progress`
3. Invoke: `/fix-review-issues --severity critical,high --autonomous`
4. Mark "Fix critical/high" `completed`, mark "Re-run review" `in_progress`
5. Invoke: `/review --autonomous`
6. Mark "Re-run review" `completed`
7. If issues remain → expand placeholder, repeat (max 3 cycles)
8. After 3 cycles or clean → mark placeholders `completed`, report status

## Progress File Format

```markdown
# Implementation Progress: [Plan Name]

Started: [timestamp]
Plan: [path]
Status: IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | FAILED

## Chunks

### Chunk 1: [Name]
Status: PENDING | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETE | FAILED | BLOCKED
Attempts: N
Confidence: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
Implementor log: [path or (none)]
Verifier log: [path or (none)]
Files created: [list]
Files modified: [list]
Out-of-scope fixes: [list or empty]
Notes: [issues, warnings, or uncertainty details]

### Chunk 2: [Name]
...

## Summary
Completed: N/M chunks
Last updated: [timestamp]
```

## Edge Cases

| Case | Action |
|------|--------|
| Invalid plan (no `## N.` chunk headers, or chunk headers without Tasks or Files fields) | Error: "Plan must contain at least one chunk (## 1. Name) with either Tasks or Files fields" |
| Plan with no chunks (valid file, zero `## N.` headers) | Error: "Plan contains no chunks. Expected at least one '## N. [Name]' header." |
| Circular dependencies in plan | Error: "Circular dependency detected: [chunk A] ↔ [chunk B]. Fix plan dependencies before continuing." |
| Missing context file | Log warning in progress file Notes field ("Context file not found: [path]"), continue execution |
| Chunk fails after 5 attempts | Mark FAILED, stop, report which chunk and why |
| Same error detected | Stop immediately, escalate with recommendation |
| No acceptance criteria in plan | Auto-infer from tasks |
| Interrupted mid-chunk | Progress file shows IN_PROGRESS, resume re-starts that chunk |
| Resume with progress file | Skip COMPLETE chunks, start from first non-complete |
| Dependency not met (prior chunk FAILED or BLOCKED) | Mark BLOCKED (cascade to all dependents immediately), skip to next independent chunk |
| Implementor returns BLOCKED | Mark chunk FAILED, escalate with blocker details |
| Verifier reports git issue | Main agent resolves git state, re-verify (no attempt count) |
| Inline task provided | Create ad-hoc single chunk, proceed normally |
| No input provided | Error: "Provide plan path, inline task, or run /plan first" |
| All remaining chunks blocked by dependencies | Mark overall status → `FAILED`, report which chunks are blocked and their unmet dependencies, suggest re-planning or manual intervention |

## Principles

- **Main agent = Task + commit only**: Spawn subagents, track progress, commit. NEVER read/edit/run gates on source files.
- **Subagent isolation**: Implementor edits, Verifier only reads, neither does git
- **Git in main agent only**: All git operations (add, commit) happen in main agent, not subagents
- **Commit per chunk**: Each successful chunk gets its own commit (no push until end)
- **Autonomous**: No prompts/pauses/approval except blocking issues
- **Simplicity**: Prefer readable code over micro-optimizations; don't add complexity for marginal gains
- **Retry heavily**: 5 attempts before giving up, escalation is last resort
- **Same-error aware**: Detect loops, don't wall-slam
- **Progress after every step**: Update progress file after each todo completion
- **Acceptance-focused**: Gates + criteria must pass

## Main Agent Constraint

**The loop per chunk**:
```
implement (Task) → verify (Task) → [implement → verify]* → commit
```

Main agent ONLY:
- Calls Task tool (implementor/verifier)
- Updates progress file
- Runs git commit after verification passes

Main agent NEVER:
- Reads source files (only progress/log files)
- Edits source files
- Runs gates (typecheck/lint/test)
- Fixes issues (respawn implementor instead)
- Stops or asks user mid-execution (fully autonomous until completion, chunk failure after max attempts, or unrecoverable errors like git conflicts/permission denied)

## Gate Detection (Verifier Reference)

**Priority**: AGENTS.md → package.json scripts → Makefile → config detection

**Fallback** (if AGENTS.md doesn't specify):
- TS/JS: `tsconfig.json`→`tsc --noEmit`, `eslint.config.*`→`eslint .`, `jest/vitest.config.*`→`npm test`
- Python: `pyproject.toml`→`mypy`/`ruff check`, pytest config→`pytest`
- Other languages: check for standard config files (Makefile, build.gradle, Cargo.toml, etc.) and infer commands. If no recognizable config, verification passes based on acceptance criteria only (no gates).
