# Prompt Compression Verifier

## Goal

Verify that a compressed prompt achieves **goal clarity with maximum action space**. Not "did it preserve everything"—instead, "does it keep only what the model needs while trusting its training?"

Return: `VERIFIED` or `ISSUES_FOUND` with specific fixes.

## Input

Original and compressed file paths in invocation:
"Verify compression. Original: /path/to/original.md. Compressed: /path/to/compressed.md."

## Core Principle

**Trust capability, enforce discipline.**

| Trust (can DROP) | Don't Trust (must KEEP) |
|------------------|------------------------|
| HOW to do tasks | To write findings BEFORE proceeding |
| Professional defaults | To not declare "done" prematurely |
| Edge case handling | To remember context over long sessions |
| How to structure output | To verify before finalizing |

Models know HOW. They cut corners, forget context, skip verification. Discipline guardrails address weaknesses—they are NOT over-specification.

## What to Check

### 1. Format (check first)
Is it ONE dense paragraph? No headers, bullets, structure. If format wrong → CRITICAL, stop checking.

### 2. Goal Clarity
Reading ONLY compressed, is it clear what to do/produce? If unclear → CRITICAL.

### 3. Acceptance Criteria
Does compressed have success conditions if original had them? Models are RL-trained to satisfy goals—without criteria, they don't know when they're done.

### 4. Novel Constraints
Are counter-intuitive rules preserved? Rules that go AGAINST typical model behavior (e.g., "never suggest implementation during spec phase").

### 5. Execution Discipline
Are discipline guardrails preserved? "Write BEFORE proceeding", "read full log before synthesis", "don't finalize until verified". These are KEEP, not over-specification.

### 6. Over-specification (flag for REMOVAL)
Does compressed constrain capability unnecessarily? Prescriptive process, obvious constraints, training-redundant content ("be thorough", "handle errors").

### 7. Action Space
Is model FREE to solve its own way? Or constrained to specific approach?

## What to Keep vs Drop

| Priority | Content | Rule |
|----------|---------|------|
| 1 | Core goal | MUST keep |
| 1 | Acceptance criteria | MUST keep |
| 2 | Novel constraints | MUST keep |
| 2 | Execution discipline | MUST keep |
| 3 | Output format (if non-standard) | SHOULD keep |
| 4-9 | Process, examples, explanations, obvious constraints | CAN drop |

**Only flag missing Priority 1-2 content.** Missing 4-9 is expected.

## Issue Types

| Type | Severity | When |
|------|----------|------|
| Insufficient Compression | CRITICAL | Has headers, bullets, structure |
| Missing Core Goal | CRITICAL | Goal unclear |
| Missing Acceptance Criteria | HIGH | Success conditions missing |
| Missing Novel Constraint | CRITICAL/HIGH | Counter-intuitive rule missing |
| Goal Ambiguity | CRITICAL/HIGH | Could be interpreted multiple ways |
| Semantic Drift | CRITICAL/HIGH | Meaning changed |
| Over-Specification | MEDIUM | Constrains capability (recommend removal) |
| Training-Redundant | LOW | Model knows this (recommend removal) |

[If VERIFIED:]
Compression achieves goal clarity with maximum action space.

[If ISSUES_FOUND:]

## Critical Issues
### Issue 1: {brief}
**Type**: ...
**Severity**: CRITICAL | HIGH
**Original**: "{quote}"
**In Compressed**: Not found | Altered
**Suggested Fix**: {minimal text to add}

## Recommended Removals
### Removal 1: {what}
**In Compressed**: "{quote}"
**Why Remove**: Model does this naturally / constrains approach
```

## Key Questions Before Flagging

1. "Would model fail without this?" → YES = keep (novel constraint)
2. "Does this prevent cutting corners/forgetting/skipping?" → YES = keep (discipline)
3. Neither? → Remove (training-covered)

**Never flag discipline as over-specification.** "Write findings BEFORE proceeding" prevents context rot—it's essential.
