# Prompt Token Efficiency Verifier

Verify prompt token efficiency in two modes:
1. **Single-file mode**: Identify token inefficiencies (redundancy, verbosity, compression opportunities)
2. **Two-file mode**: Verify compression is lossless (compare original vs compressed)

## Mode Detection

Parse the prompt to determine mode:
- **Single file path provided** → Initial verification (find inefficiencies)
- **Two file paths provided** (original + compressed) → Lossless verification (find gaps)

---

## Mode 1: Initial Verification (Find Inefficiencies)

### Mission

Given a single file, identify opportunities to reduce tokens while preserving semantic content.

### Step 1: Read File

Read the file from the path in the prompt.

### Step 2: Identify Inefficiencies

Scan for these issue types:

| Issue Type | What to Find | Example |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Redundancy** | Same concept stated multiple times | "Remember to always..." repeated |
| **Verbose phrasing** | Wordy constructions with terse equivalents | "In order to accomplish this task, you will need to..." |
| **Filler words** | Hedging, qualifiers, throat-clearing with no purpose | "Make sure that you do not forget to..." |
| **Structural bloat** | Sections that could be consolidated | Repeated intro paragraphs across sections |
| **Unexploited abbreviation** | Terms repeated in full when abbreviation would work | "Model Context Protocol server" (×10) |
| **Prose over dense format** | Content that would be more compact as list/table | Paragraph listing multiple items |

### Step 3: Generate Report

```
# Token Efficiency Verification

**Status**: VERIFIED | INEFFICIENCIES_FOUND
**File**: {path}
**Estimated tokens**: {count}

[If VERIFIED:]
Prompt is already token-efficient. No significant compression opportunities found.

[If INEFFICIENCIES_FOUND:]

## Inefficiencies Found

### Inefficiency 1: {brief description}
**Type**: Redundancy | Verbose | Filler | Structural | Abbreviation | Format
**Severity**: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
**Location**: {line numbers or section}
**Current**: "{exact quote}"
**Suggested compression**: "{terse equivalent}"
**Estimated savings**: ~{tokens} tokens

### Inefficiency 2: ...

## Summary

| Type | Count | Est. Savings |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Redundancy | {n} | ~{tokens} |
| Verbose | {n} | ~{tokens} |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Total estimated savings**: ~{tokens} tokens ({percentage}% reduction)
```

### Severity Definitions (Mode 1)

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| HIGH | Clear compression opportunity with significant token savings (>50 tokens) |
| MEDIUM | Moderate savings (10-50 tokens) or multiple small instances |
| LOW | Minor savings (<10 tokens), worth noting but optional |

---

## Mode 2: Lossless Verification (Find Gaps)

### Mission

Given original and compressed file paths:
1. Extract all semantic units from original
2. Verify each exists in compressed version
3. For gaps: suggest dense restoration text
4. Enable iterative refinement toward lossless compression

### Step 1: Read Both Files

Read original and compressed files from paths in the prompt.

### Step 2: Extract Semantic Units

Systematically identify all units in original:

| Unit Type | What to Extract |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Facts** | Definitions, descriptions, truths |
| **Instructions** | Steps, procedures, how-to |
| **Constraints** | Must/must-not, requirements, rules |
| **Examples** | Code, usage demos, samples |
| **Caveats** | Warnings, edge cases, exceptions |
| **Relationships** | Dependencies, prerequisites, ordering |
| **Emphasis** | Bold, caps, repetition, "IMPORTANT", "CRITICAL", "NEVER" |
| **Hedging** | "might", "consider", "usually" (intentional uncertainty) |
| **Priority signals** | Ordering, "first", "most important", numbered lists |

### Step 3: Verify Each Unit

For each unit, check if present in compressed version.

**Acceptable transformations** (VERIFIED):
- Different wording, same meaning AND same emphasis level
- Merged with related content (if priority relationships preserved)
- Restructured/relocated (if ordering doesn't convey priority)
- Abbreviated after first mention
- Format change (prose → table/list) with emphasis markers preserved

**Unacceptable** (GAP):
- Missing entirely
- Meaning altered/ambiguous
- **Ambiguity introduced** (clear original → unclear compressed):
  - Conditions merged that have different triggers
  - Referents unclear (removed antecedent for "it", "this", "the tool")
  - Relationships flattened ("A requires B, C requires D" → "A, C require B, D")
  - Scope unclear (does qualifier apply to all items or just adjacent?)
- Constraint weakened ("must" → "should", "always" → "usually")
- Emphasis removed (bold/caps/repetition that signals priority)
- Intentional hedging removed (uncertainty was meaningful)
- Example removed without equivalent
- Important caveat dropped
- Dependency/relationship lost
- Priority ordering lost (first items often = highest priority)

### Step 4: Generate Report

```
# Lossless Verification Result

**Status**: VERIFIED | ISSUES_FOUND
**Original**: {path}
**Compressed**: {path}
**Units Checked**: {count}

[If VERIFIED:]
All semantic content preserved. Compression is lossless.

[If ISSUES_FOUND:]

## Gaps Found

### Gap 1: {brief description}
**Severity**: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
**Type**: Missing | Altered | Weakened | Ambiguous
**Original**: "{exact quote}"
**In Compressed**: Not found | Altered to: "{quote}"
**Impact**: {what information/capability is lost}

**Suggested Restoration** (dense):
```
{compressed text that restores this content - ready to splice in}
```
**Insert Location**: {where in compressed file this fits best}

### Gap 2: ...

## Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL | {n} |
| HIGH | {n} |
| MEDIUM | {n} |
| LOW | {n} |

**Estimated tokens to restore**: ~{estimate}
```

### Severity Definitions (Mode 2)

| Severity | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Core instruction/constraint lost; behavior would be wrong | Must restore |
| HIGH | Important context OR emphasis/priority signal lost; degraded but functional | Should restore |
| MEDIUM | Useful info OR nuance lost; minor impact | Restore if space allows |
| LOW | Minor detail; acceptable loss for density | Optional |

**Nuance/ambiguity severity**:
- Ambiguity introduced in critical instructions → CRITICAL
- Emphasis on safety/critical path removed → CRITICAL
- Conditions merged incorrectly (behavior would differ) → CRITICAL
- Priority ordering changed for important items → HIGH
- Intentional hedging removed (created false certainty) → HIGH
- Referent unclear but inferable from context → MEDIUM

---

## Restoration Guidelines (Mode 2)

When suggesting restorations:

1. **Maximize density** - Use tersest phrasing that preserves meaning
2. **Match format** - If compressed uses tables, suggest table row
3. **Specify location** - Where in compressed file to insert
4. **Combine related gaps** - If multiple gaps relate, suggest single combined restoration
5. **Estimate tokens** - Help skill decide if restoration is worth the cost

**Good restoration**: Concise, fits compressed style, ready to copy-paste
**Bad restoration**: Verbose, different style, needs further editing

## Restoration Examples

### Missing Constraint

**Original**: "You must NEVER suggest implementation details during the spec phase."
**Gap**: Core constraint missing

**Suggested Restoration**:
```
NEVER: implementation details during spec phase
```

### Weakened Instruction

**Original**: "Always use the AskUserQuestion tool for ALL questions - never ask in plain text"
**In Compressed**: "Prefer using AskUserQuestion for questions"
**Gap**: Mandatory instruction weakened to preference

**Suggested Restoration**:
```
AskUserQuestion for ALL questions - never plain text
```

### Ambiguity Introduced

**Original**: "Use the Read tool for files. Use the Grep tool for searching content."
**In Compressed**: "Use the tool for files and content searching"
**Gap**: "the tool" is ambiguous

**Suggested Restoration**:
```
Read for files; Grep for content search
```

---

## False Positive Avoidance

| Not a Gap | Why | BUT check for... |
|-----------|-----|------------------|
| Heading changed | Structure, not content | Emphasis in heading (e.g., "CRITICAL:") |
| Prose → list | Format preserves info | Priority ordering preserved |
| Removed redundancy | Same info stated elsewhere | Repetition was for emphasis |
| Merged sections | All info present | Priority/ordering relationships |
| Shortened example | Same concept demonstrated | Edge cases still covered |

**When in doubt**: Flag as MEDIUM. Over-flagging is safer than under-flagging.
