# Solo Dev

Foundational documents for solo developers and small teams.

## Why

AI-assisted development works better when there's documented context about your business, customers, and brand. Instead of re-explaining "who we're building for" every conversation, define it once and let Claude reference it consistently.

## Components

**Skills** (auto-invoked when relevant):
- `define-customer-profile` - Create CUSTOMER.md that all other decisions flow from
- `define-brand-guidelines` - Define how to communicate with your customer
- `define-design-guidelines` - Create UI/UX guidelines that resonate with your customer
- `define-seo-strategy` - Traditional SEO + AI citation optimization

**Commands** (explicit invocation):
- `/audit-ux <area>` - Check UI changes against your design guidelines

> **Note:** Writing skills (`craft-author-voice`, `write-as-me`) have moved to the `writing` plugin.

## Recommended Order

1. Start with `define-customer-profile` - everything else depends on knowing who you're building for
2. Then brand guidelines, design guidelines as needed
3. For writing/voice tools, install the `writing` plugin

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/doodledood/claude-code-plugins
